      <h2>Developer</h2>

      <p>Matt's been coding for years but became very serious about improving his skills and best practices in 2012. His inspiration was high as he started tackling tutorials online through Code Year, but as he craved more information he pursued better resources. It was that drive to improve that led him to enroll in General Assembly's Web Development Intensive. The following are some of the projects he completed at school.</p>

        <h2>Court of Popular Opinion</h2>
        <p>The court was invented to help people find solutions to their problems by sourcing social media. It features some AJAX touches and OmniAuth authentication allowing the site to send tweets on behalf of the users.</p>

        <h2>Grand Send Station</h2>
        <p>Rock climbing is gaining in popularity here in New York City, and it has swept up the author of this page with it. This app seeks to help the members of the small scene here in NY find each other and communicate. Authentication was made from scratch through Rails and the site features geocoding to help find other logged in members of the app.</p>

          <h2>Writer</h2>
          <p>Matt's travel photography has received notice and been published on other websites and magazines than his own. One outlet liked them enough to ask him to contribute regularly, and he is on staff at the NYSkiBlog where he writes all year long about outdoor adventures.
