      <h2>Developer</h2>
      <p>Matt decided to tackle tutorials online through Code Year but, craving more information, he pursued more in depth resources. It was that drive to improve that led him to enroll in General Assembly's Web Development Intensive. The following are some of the projects he has completed. Matt is an incessant builder and hopes to update both the functionality of this portfolio and ship many new projects in the years to come.</p>

        <h2>Dossier</h2>
        <p>Craving a new challenge, Matt sat down with friend and GA classmate <a href="https://github.com/fijimunkii">Harrison Powers</a> to cook up Dossier. The idea is to study up on faces before you meet, or even after, to avoid any embarassment if you forget. Everyone loves having their name remembered, so we used authorization with Facebook and LinkedIn to create this useful little app. While you're there, you can also toggle your RSVP's and play some memory games.

        <h2>Goin' Places</h2>
        <p>Along with <a href="http://www.github.com/ksantiago">Kat Santiago</a>, Matt developed Goin' Places in order to share itineraries easily and follow each otherâ€™s trip progress. Their idea was partially inspired by Github's approach to code, as Goin' Places hopes to create an open and crowd-sourced travel application for all.

        <h2>Court of Popular Opinion</h2>
        <p>The court was invented to help people find solutions to their problems by sourcing social media. It features some AJAX touches and OmniAuth authentication allowing the site to send tweets on behalf of the users.</p>

         <h2>Grand Send Station</h2>
        <p>Rock climbing is gaining in popularity in New York City, and it has swept up the author of this page with it. This app seeks to help members find each other and communicate. Authentication was made from scratch through Rails and the site features geocoding to help locate other logged in members of the app.</p>

        <h2>Photographer</h2>
        <p>When Matt isn't working out some code, he's probably trying to sneak in a breath of fresh air outside. He usually brings his camera and you can find his work on Instagram or iShotMattLucas.com.
