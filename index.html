      <h2>Developer</h2>
      <p>Matt originally decided to tackle tutorials online through Code Year but craving more information, he pursued ever more in depth resources. It was that drive to improve that led him to enroll in General Assembly's Web Development Intensive. The following are some of the projects he has completed both there, and since. Matt is an incessant builder and hopes to update both the functionality of this portfolio and ship many new projects in the years to come.</p>

        <h2>Dossier</h2>
        <p>Craving a new challenge, Matt sat down with friend and GA classmate <a href="https://github.com/fijimunkii">Harrison Powers</a> to cook up Dossier. The idea was to be able study up on the faces of people you are likely to meet an event, or even after, to avoid any embarassment over forgetting or to have a conversation starter. Everyone loves having their name remembered, so we used authorization through Facebook and LinkedIn to create this useful little app. While you're logged in, a user can also toggle their RSVP's and play some memory games.

        <h2>Goin' Places</h2>
        <p>Along with <a href="http://www.github.com/ksantiago">Kat Santiago</a>, Matt developed Goin' Places in order to share itineraries easily and follow each other’s trip progress. Their idea was partially inspired by Github's approach to code, as Goin' Places hopes to create an open and crowd-sourced travel application for all.

        <h2>Court of Popular Opinion</h2>

         <h2>Grand Send Station</h2>
        <p>Rock climbing is gaining in popularity in New York City, and it has swept up the author of this page with it. This app seeks to help members find each other and communicate. Authentication was made from scratch through Rails and the site features geocoding to help locate other logged in members of the app.</p>
