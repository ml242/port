      <h2>Developer</h2>
      <p>Matt decided to tackle tutorials online through Code Year but, craving more information, he pursued more in depth resources. It was that drive to improve that led him to enroll in General Assembly's Web Development Intensive. The following are some of the projects he completed at school.</p>

        <h2>Goin' Places</h2>
        <p>Along with <a href="http://www.github.com/ksantiago">Kat Santiago</a>, Matt developed Goin' Places in order to share itineraries easily and follow each otherâ€™s trip progress. Their idea was partially inspired by Github's approach to code, as Goin' Places hopes to create an open and crowd-sourced travel application for all.
