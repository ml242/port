      <h2>Developer</h2>
      <p>Matt's been coding for years but became very serious about improving his skills and best practices in 2012. His inspiration was high as he started tackling tutorials online through Code Year, but as he craved more information he pursued better resources. It was that drive to improve that led him to enroll in General Assembly's Web Development Intensive. The following are some of the projects he completed at school.</p>
